## Description

Welcome to my Weather Dashboard
The weather dashboard does the following:

- You can search for any city by typing in the city name in the search input
- The weather dashboard will call ![Three Open Weather Map APIs](https://openweathermap.org/api) (current, one call and 5 day forecast).
- You will then see the current weather for that time, as well as a future forecast for the following five days.
- Your last five searches will be saved in the search card.
- If you close your browser and re-visit the page, your recent searches will be saved in localstorage and display accordingly.
